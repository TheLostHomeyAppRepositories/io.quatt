Stay connected with your Quatt heatpump and know when and how it's heating your home. With this Homey app, you can
use the sensor data from your Quatt heatpump to create flows to act on changes in the heatpump.

Note to Quatt Duo users: this app will show your Quatt heatpumps as a single device, but the values of both heatpumps
are available as separate sensor values.

Available sensor values:
- Central heating mode (boiler)
- Central heating active (cic)
- Central heating on/off (cic)
- Hot water active (boiler)
- Boiler flame on
- Boiler incoming water temperature
- Boiler outgoing water temperature
- Water flow speed (flowmeter)
- Water supply temperature (flowmeter)
- Supervisory control mode (quality control)
- Outside temperature (heatpump)
- Limited by COP (heatpump)
- Silent mode (heatpump)
- Heatpump incoming water temperature
- Heatpump outgoing water temperature
- Heatpump working mode
- Thermal power (heatpump)
- Power consumption (heatpump)
- Thermostat heating on
- Thermostat cooling on
- Thermostat hot water on
- Room temperature (thermostat)
- Room temperature setpoint (thermostat)
- Water supply temperature setpoint (thermostat)

Computed sensor values:
- Heatpump COP
- Heatpump water temperature difference
